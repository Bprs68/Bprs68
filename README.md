# Hi, I'm Bhaskar Kumar 👋  
### AI / ML Engineer | Generative AI | Agentic AI | Production ML Systems

I’m an **AI / ML Engineer with 2.5+ years of hands-on experience** building **production-grade AI systems** across **Machine Learning, NLP, Generative AI, and Agentic AI**.  
I specialize in taking AI solutions **from idea → prototype → scalable production**.

Currently, I work as a **Specialist, Software Engineering (Data & AI)** at **Accelerate People (Blenheim Chalcot)**, where I design and deploy **LLM-powered, agentic, and multimodal AI systems** used at scale.

---

## 🚀 What I Work On

- **Agentic AI & RAG Systems** (LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen)
- **LLM-based Applications** (OpenAI, Azure-hosted models)
- **Production ML Systems** (FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD)
- **Multimodal AI** (OCR, Vision Transformers, NLP)
- **MLOps** (model monitoring, drift detection, retraining pipelines)
- **Cloud AI Platforms** (Azure, AWS)

📌 **Impact Highlight:**  
Reduced assessment turnaround time from **72 hours to under 3 hours** by architecting an AI-backed assessment platform used by the **UK’s largest apprenticeship body**.
